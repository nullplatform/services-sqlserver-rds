# Install — registers the rds-sqlserver-server service definition and its
# agent association (notification channel) on a nullplatform account, and
# (optionally) the account-level providers the "nullplatform Prerequisites"
# section of ../../../README.md documents as required:
#
#   - aws-configuration / aws-networking-configuration (account-level NRN):
#     build_context resolves account.region and vpc.id from these. Toggle
#     with create_account_providers — skip if another stack in this account
#     already registers them (they are shared, not specific to this service).
#   - aws-iam-configuration (account-level NRN): the AssumeRole target for
#     scripts/aws/assume_role_step, which resolves it via `np provider list
#     --categories identity-access-control` using the service's full NRN —
#     that call walks UP the NRN hierarchy, so registering this provider at
#     the account level (rather than namespace/application) is what makes it
#     resolve for every service/namespace under the account. This module is
#     the ONLY place that should create it for the account — the underlying
#     nullplatform_provider_config resource is a plain create with no
#     merge/upsert semantics, so a second, independent identity_access_control
#     resource (e.g. one created by rds-sqlserver-db's own install) would
#     register a SECOND aws-iam-configuration provider at the same NRN, and
#     assume_role_step's lookup would then nondeterministically pick one of
#     the two. rds-sqlserver-db does NOT create its own — pass its role ARN
#     via rds_sqlserver_db_role_arn to fold its selector into this single
#     provider instead.
#
# The AWS AssumeRole IAM role/policies themselves (the permissions role this
# provider points at) live in ../../requirements/aws and are applied
# separately — see that module's README and the "AssumeRole Setup Guide" in
# ../../../README.md.
